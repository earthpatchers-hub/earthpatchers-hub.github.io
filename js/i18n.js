      // Missions HQ
      'missions-hq.title': 'Missions HQ',
      'missions-hq.subtitle': 'The Heart of EarthPatchers',
      'missions-hq.desc': 'Missions HQ is the beating heart of EarthPatchers. It\u2019s where families and young people find real-world eco missions \u2014 from quick 10-minute actions to weekend adventures. Every mission is designed to be doable, age-appropriate, and meaningful. You can filter by time, interest, and age group, track your progress with badges and points, and build a personal timeline of everything you\u2019ve done for the planet.',
      'missions-hq.why': 'Missions turn climate anxiety into doable action. They give families and young people a clear starting point, with a habit-first approach: one mission at a time, building real change step by step.',
      'missions-hq.loopy': 'Loopy, the little bear, scratched his head and looked around the forest clearing. "What can I do today?" he wondered. The Missions HQ board was glowing softly under the big oak tree. "Plant a seed," one card said. "Pick up 5 pieces of litter near the stream," said another. "Help a neighbour carry their recycling." Loopy smiled. He didn\u2019t need to save the whole forest today. He just needed to start. He picked the seed card, tucked it into his bandana, and trotted off toward the meadow. One small mission, one small bear, one big difference.',

      // Tribes
      'tribes.title': 'Tribes',
      'tribes.subtitle': 'Your Local Crew',
      'tribes.desc': 'Tribes are small, local groups that do missions together, meet up, and support each other. Think of them as your neighbourhood crew for sustainability. Whether it\u2019s a school class, a group of parents, or a youth club, Tribes make EarthPatchers social, consistent, and fun. The rhythm is realistic \u2014 monthly or seasonal, not a weekly obligation. And every tribe is connected to the platform\u2019s safety system from day one.',
      'tribes.why': 'Sustainability isn\u2019t just about tasks. It\u2019s about belonging. Tribes turn the platform into a community where people support each other and act together.',
      'tribes.loopy': 'Loopy arrived at the oak stump circle just as the sun was setting. The other animals were already there: Mira the fox, Pip the hedgehog, and old Barbu the badger. "Welcome to the Moonlight Tribe," Mira said. "We meet once a month, right here." "What do we do?" Loopy asked. "Whatever the forest needs," Barbu said. "Last month we fixed the trail. This month, we\u2019re planting wildflowers by the stream." "And next month?" "We\u2019ll decide together." Loopy sat down and smiled. He wasn\u2019t alone anymore.',

      // Market Hut
      'market-hut.title': 'Market Hut',
      'market-hut.subtitle': 'Swap, Share, Reuse',
      'market-hut.desc': 'Market Hut is where circular habits come to life. It\u2019s a safe, community-driven space for swapping, giving away, and reusing things locally. From kids\u2019 clothes and books to tools and toys, Market Hut makes it easy to pass things on instead of throwing them away. Everything is moderated, with clear exchange rules, adult-managed interactions, and safe pickup guidance. In the future, it will also include a \u201cborrow library\u201d for things you only need once.',
      'market-hut.why': 'Circular habits are one of the fastest ways to reduce waste. Market Hut makes reuse safe, easy, and social \u2014 connecting it directly to missions so it becomes a habit, not a one-time act.',
      'market-hut.loopy': 'Loopy had outgrown his favourite rain boots. They were still good \u2014 just too small. He carried them to the Market Hut, a cosy wooden stall under the big chestnut tree. "I\u2019d like to give these away," he said. Old Nana Owl checked the boots, nodded, and placed them on the shelf. "Someone will be very happy," she said. The next morning, Pip the hedgehog was splashing through puddles in bright green boots, grinning from ear to ear. "They fit!" he squeaked. Loopy waved. That was the best part: nothing wasted, everything shared.',

      // Earth's Side of the Story
      'earth-side.title': "Earth's Side of the Story",
      'earth-side.subtitle': 'Learning That Grows with You',
      'earth-side.desc': 'Earth\u2019s Side of the Story is EarthPatchers\u2019 learning module. It\u2019s an interactive, age-appropriate experience that helps people understand why sustainability matters \u2014 without overwhelm or guilt. Think of it like an \u201cEncarta-style\u201d globe and map, where you can explore topics like pollution, climate change, water, energy, and biodiversity \u2014 all explained in plain language, adapted for different age groups (5\u20137, 8\u201311, 12\u201314, 14\u201318). Learning paths include quizzes and mini-games that unlock new regions, badges, and skills. It\u2019s built to grow step by step, starting small and adding depth over time.',
      'earth-side.why': 'Understanding "why" is the bridge between action and lasting change. This module makes climate science accessible, emotionally safe, and deeply connected to the missions people do in real life.',
      'earth-side.loopy': 'Loopy found the old globe in the library hollow. When he touched it, it glowed. "Where would you like to go?" it asked. "The ocean," Loopy whispered. The globe spun, and suddenly he was watching tiny fish swim through coral reefs. "This reef is struggling," the globe said gently. "Warmer water makes it harder for coral to survive." "What can I do?" Loopy asked. "Start small. Use less plastic. Tell your friends. And keep learning." Loopy nodded. He didn\u2019t have all the answers, but now he understood the question. And that was the beginning.',

      // Games Room
      'games-room.title': 'Games Room',
      'games-room.subtitle': 'Play With a Purpose',
      'games-room.desc': 'The Games Room is where fun meets learning. It\u2019s a collection of short, engaging mini-games that teach sustainability concepts through play. Think sorting waste, matching animals to habitats, water-saving challenges, and seasonal nature quizzes. Games are designed for different age groups, quick to play, and connected to real missions. The Games Room makes sustainability something kids actually want to do \u2014 and parents can join in too.',
      'games-room.why': 'Play is how children learn best. Short, purposeful games reinforce what kids learn through missions and make the platform a place they want to come back to.',
      'games-room.loopy': 'Loopy heard laughter coming from the hollow log. Inside, Mira the fox was sorting acorns and pinecones into baskets. "What are you doing?" Loopy asked. "Playing the Sorting Game!" Mira said. "You have to put each thing in the right place: compost, recycle, or reuse. Want to try?" Loopy tried. He got a few wrong at first, but then he got faster. "I didn\u2019t know banana peels could be composted!" he said. "Now you do," Mira grinned. "And tomorrow, you\u2019ll remember." They played three more rounds. Learning had never felt this fun.',

      // Activity Hut
      'activity-hut.title': 'Activity Hut',
      'activity-hut.subtitle': 'Hands-On Projects for All Ages',
      'activity-hut.desc': 'The Activity Hut is EarthPatchers\u2019 creative workshop. It\u2019s a space full of DIY activities, nature crafts, seasonal projects, and hands-on guides that families and young people can do together. Think birdhouse building, seed bombing, DIY beeswax wraps, upcycling old t-shirts, and seasonal nature journals. Every activity is designed to be fun, educational, and connected to real sustainability goals. Activities are tagged by age, difficulty, season, and materials needed \u2014 so it\u2019s easy to find something that works for you.',
      'activity-hut.why': 'Doing things with your hands builds real understanding. The Activity Hut turns sustainability into something tangible, shareable, and genuinely fun for the whole family.',
      'activity-hut.loopy': 'Loopy walked into the Activity Hut and gasped. The walls were covered in drawings, dried flowers, and tiny birdhouses. "What\u2019s today\u2019s activity?" he asked. "Seed bombs!" said Lina the rabbit, holding up a ball of mud and seeds. "You roll them, dry them, and throw them in a field. Flowers grow where they land." Loopy made seven seed bombs. Some were lumpy, some were perfect. He carried them to the edge of the meadow and tossed them one by one. "By spring," Lina said, "this whole field will be full of wildflowers." Loopy couldn\u2019t wait.',

      // Eco Shops Directory
      'eco-shops.title': 'Eco Shops Directory',
      'eco-shops.subtitle': 'Find What\'s Truly Sustainable',
      'eco-shops.desc': 'The Eco Shops Directory is a curated, community-driven guide to sustainable shops and services in your city. Starting in Cluj, it helps people find places that genuinely care about the environment \u2014 with clear criteria: refill stations, compostable products, recycled or reclaimed materials, repair services. Community members can contribute new listings using a simple template (photos, location, what makes it sustainable, pros and cons). Over time, the directory expands city by city, driven by demand and community voting.',
      'eco-shops.why': 'Finding truly sustainable shops is hard. This directory makes it simple, with clear criteria and community-driven reviews, so people can make better choices without hours of research.',
      'eco-shops.loopy': 'Loopy needed a new notebook, but he didn\u2019t want one wrapped in plastic. "Try the Eco Shops board," Mira suggested. The board was pinned to the big oak tree: a map of the forest with little green flags. "Green Acorn Stationery," Loopy read. "Recycled paper, no plastic, refills available." He followed the trail to a small shop run by a family of squirrels. The notebook was beautiful: thick recycled pages with a cover made from pressed leaves. "Who added this to the board?" Loopy asked. "I did," said Pip the hedgehog proudly. "I found this place last month." That\u2019s how the directory grew: one good find at a time.',

      // Green Wall
      'green-wall.title': 'The Green Wall',
      'green-wall.subtitle': 'Where Ideas Become Real',
      'green-wall.desc': 'The Green Wall is EarthPatchers\u2019 community idea board. It\u2019s where anyone can post an idea for a sustainability project, and the community votes on what matters most (Impact + Feasibility). People join ideas with their skills (design, education, tech, legal, organising), and ideas rise as teams form and support appears. It\u2019s like a public startup board for the community: transparent, skill-driven, and focused on turning good intentions into real projects. Ideas that gain traction can attract mentors, sponsors, or local funding.',
      'green-wall.why': 'Good ideas need more than enthusiasm. They need skills, teamwork, and sometimes funding. The Green Wall turns community energy into real projects.',
      'green-wall.loopy': 'Loopy had an idea: "What if we planted fruit trees along the main path so everyone could eat for free in autumn?" He wrote it on a leaf and pinned it to the Green Wall. The next day, three animals had voted for it. By the end of the week, a whole team had formed: Barbu knew where to plant, Mira knew which trees grew best, and Pip offered to water them every morning. "All it took," Loopy thought, "was one leaf on a wall." By autumn, the path was lined with apple and plum trees. And every animal who walked by took a bite and smiled.',

      // Organisations & Scientists
      'org-scientists.title': 'Organisations & Scientists',
      'org-scientists.subtitle': 'Trusted Knowledge for Real Action',
      'org-scientists.desc': 'This module connects EarthPatchers to the world of trusted science, research, and expert organisations. It\u2019s a curated space where verified scientists, environmental NGOs, and research teams can share knowledge, co-create missions, and provide fact-checked content for the platform\u2019s learning layer. Community members can see who stands behind the information they\u2019re learning, making trust visible. Over time, it becomes a bridge between grassroots community action and the research world, ensuring that what people do is backed by real evidence.',
      'org-scientists.why': 'Sustainability needs trusted information. This module ensures that the platform\u2019s content is reliable, evidence-based, and connected to real experts who care about making science accessible.',
      'org-scientists.loopy': 'Loopy had a question nobody in the forest could answer: "Why is the stream warmer this year?" He followed the signs to the big oak where Professor Hoot the owl held office hours. "Ah," said Professor Hoot, adjusting her glasses. "That\u2019s a very good question. Let me show you the data." She unrolled a long scroll with charts and pictures. "The stream is warmer because the trees upstream were cut down. Without shade, the water heats up." "Can we fix it?" Loopy asked. "Yes. Plant shade trees along the bank. I\u2019ll show your tribe exactly where and what to plant." Loopy smiled. Now they didn\u2019t just have a feeling. They had a plan.',

      // New Cities & Discovery Phase
      'new-cities.title': 'New Cities & Discovery Phase',
      'new-cities.subtitle': 'Growing Together, City by City',
      'new-cities.desc': 'New Cities & Discovery Phase is how EarthPatchers grows beyond Cluj. It\u2019s a transparent, community-driven expansion model where the community votes on the next city to join, and resources are managed through clear "City Funds" that show exactly what gets delivered at 30%, 60%, and 100% funding. Every new city starts with a Discovery Phase: a light version of the platform where early adopters test missions, build a local tribe, and help shape the city\u2019s unique character on the platform. It\u2019s not just about copying \u2014 it\u2019s about growing together.',
      'new-cities.why': 'Scaling should be transparent and community-driven. City Funds let everyone see where resources go, and voting ensures expansion reflects real demand.',
      'new-cities.loopy': 'One day, a letter arrived at the forest clearing. "Dear EarthPatchers," it read. "We\u2019re a group of animals from the Mountain Valley. We heard about what you\u2019re doing and we want to start something similar here." Loopy gathered the tribe. "They want to join," he said. "But they need help getting started." "We could send them our mission cards," suggested Mira. "And our rulebook," added Barbu. "And we\u2019ll visit once to help them set up their own Green Wall." A few weeks later, the Mountain Valley had its own clearing, its own tribe, and its own missions. Different forest, same spirit.',

      // Patcher Camp
      'patcher-camp.title': 'Patcher Camp',
      'patcher-camp.subtitle': 'The Big Adventure Game',
      'patcher-camp.desc': 'Patcher Camp is a cooperative adventure game set across four climate zones, where young people solve real environmental problems using their skills as superpowers. The four elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Wind) represent different sustainability themes: materials, resources, energy, and mobility. Players work together to restore balance, complete real-life micro-tasks (cleaning, repair, cooking, upcycling), and unlock new abilities. There\u2019s also a Wizard Tent \u2014 a calm, reflective space with zero-waste recipes and debrief activities, designed especially for older teens (14\u201318).',
      'patcher-camp.why': 'Games make learning irresistible. Patcher Camp connects play to real-world action, helping young people see their skills as superpowers for the planet.',
      'patcher-camp.loopy': 'Loopy put on his adventure bandana and stepped into Patcher Camp. The forest around him shimmered. "Choose your element," the old tree spirit said. "Earth," Loopy said. "I want to help with materials." His badge glowed green. His first quest: find three things in the forest that could be reused instead of thrown away. He found an old jar (lantern!), a broken branch (walking stick!), and a torn net (plant holder!). "Three out of three," the tree spirit smiled. "You\u2019ve levelled up, Earth Patcher." Loopy grinned. He wasn\u2019t just playing a game. He was becoming someone who could fix the world, one small thing at a time.',
